# ðŸš€ Node.js TypeScript Starter

This is a basic template for a Node.js backend application using TypeScript and Express. It's intended to help beginners get started with building backend applications in Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js and NPM. You can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbdouAbarchiAboubacar/nodejs_restapi_get-started.git
cd nodejs_restapi_get-started
npm install
```

Then, you can start the development server:

This will start the server and restart it automatically when any changes are made to the source code.

## Project Structure

This template has the following project structure:

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ controllers
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ app.ts
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ server.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ tslint.json
```

- `dist`: The directory where the compiled TypeScript files will be stored.
- `node_modules`: The directory where the dependencies will be installed.
- `src/controllers`: The directory where the controllers for the API routes will be stored.
- `src/models`: The directory where the database models will be stored.
- `src/routes`: The directory where the API routes will be defined.
- `src/app.ts`: The main application file that initializes the server and middleware.
- `src/server.ts`: The file that starts the server.
- `.env.example`: An example environment variables file.
- `.gitignore`: The file that specifies which files and directories to ignore when committing changes to Git.
- `package.json`: The file that specifies the project dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: The file that contains the project documentation.
- `tsconfig.json`: The file that specifies the TypeScript configuration for the project.
